### TODO list
 - fix or remove horizontal screen orientation layout on HomeActivity
 - transition/animation between fragments on home (also swipe left/right)
 - option to link a password to another one ("sign in with google account")? maybe?
 
### TODO Optional list
 - resize Example and Mahler images for faster loading
 - selectable items in RecyclerView in HomeActivity (to delete) ((maybe drag and drop position))
 - animations
 - consider using glide library for bitmaps https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics (if there's a significant performance issue)
